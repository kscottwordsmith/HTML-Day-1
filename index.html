			<h1>Do Not Go To Film School</h1>
			<p>
				There's definitely reasons to go to film school:
			</p>
			<ol>
				<li>You need structure in order to learn</li>
				<li>You want to</li>
			</ol>
			<p>
				That's it. Literally, those are the only two unassailable reasons to go to film school. "Oh, but how else am I going to learn this stuff?" There's the trap. The insidious plot at the heart of the hallowed halls of film scholarship.
			</p>
			<h3>This Stuff Is Not Secret</h3>
			<p>
				Any information a film school can give you can easily be obtained through the miracle of The Internet. Not a single thing you will learn is a huge industry secret (any professor that claims as such is lying), nor are things impossible to figure out on your own. No, here's what you should do:
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Watch Youtube videos. Yes, I'm serious. Youtube is a marvellous tool to help people learn pointless minutae but <b>also</b> important concepts. I recommend <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KznZcK7ksf4" target="_blank">Lindsay Ellis' video dissecting Disney's Hercules</a> as a good starting point, at least from a storytelling angle.</li>
				<li>Do it your own damn self. Practice makes perfect, after all, and you can't really master a craft unless you screw up a lot at it. Got a camera? Film some stuff. Got some friends? Put them to work, make some dorky-as-hell videos. Hell, you don't even really <i>need</i> a video camera proper, you have a cell phone! And chances are it's got a camera that matches or even <i>outclasses</i> the cameras I learned on. Go nuts!</li>
				<li>Watch a metric assload of movies. This cannot be stressed enough. Good movies, bad movies, schlocky TV shows, the best Netflix has to offer. Doesn't matter. Watch. It. And study the things you like! Note the things you don't! But most importantly, ask why the hell the filmmakers decided to do what they did.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>
				Actually, that reminds me of a particularly annoying thing about film school.

		<div> <!-- The extended rant about Auteur Theory -->
			<p>
				There are a staggering amount of people that work on a movie:
			</p>
			<table>
				<thead>
					<th>Job</th>
					<th>Role</th>
				</thead>
				<tfoot><!--This space intentionally left blank--></tfoot>
				<tbody>
					<tr>
						<td class="job">Director</td>
						<td>Controls the happenings on set</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td class="job">Cinematographer</td>
						<td>Controls what the camera sees</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td class="job">Screenwriter</td>
						<td>Controls what occurs in the story</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td class="job">Editor</td>
						<td>Controls in what order scenes occur</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td class="job">Actor</td>
						<td>Controls nothing of note but themselves</td>
					</tr>
				</tbody>
			</table>
			<p>
				And that's putting it mildly. A film crew can have dozens, even hundreds of people working on it. But we as humans like to define art like we define paintings. Michaelangelo painted the Sistine Chapel, Da Vinci painted the <i>Mona Lisa</i>, but who made <i>Citizen Kane</i>? Likely, you had an answer for that. "Orson Welles made that movie," is, of course, the "correct" answer to that question. Yes, he wrote, directed, and starred in it, but did he make the whole movie? I'd argue he didn't. Would <i>Reservoir Dogs</i> be half as good if Quentin Tarantino also acted the parts?
			</p>
			<h4>No.</h4>
			<p>
				And yet Auteur Theory would argue that he made the damn movie, that his creative direction is the most important part. Auteur Theory is pretty simple: The person most deserving of credit for a movie is its director. Which is flawed, as most directors don't even really control the plot of their movies, that's set by the screenwriter. They don't control how the camera picks up the action, that's the cinematographer. They certainly don't edit the damn movie. And yet we live under that French-ass theory to this very day! ...I've gotten off topic.
